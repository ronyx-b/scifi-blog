      <h2>If we could see the future, would we be any different from robots?</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In "Story of your life" (Chiang, 1998, p. 305), the character of Louise Banks reflects on the implications on being 
          able to see the future:</p>
        <blockquote>
          Knowledge of the future was incompatible with free will. What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice 
          also made it impossible for me to know the future. Conversely, now that I know the future, I would never act contrary 
          to that future
        </blockquote>
        <p>When we talk about robots, one of the distinguishing features that separates them from humans, is our free will. So, 
          if seeing the future is incompatible with free will, and this is what could distinguish us from mere automatons; what 
          would that make of us? In her remark in “Story of your life”, Louise doesn’t seem concerned about this, so maybe free 
          will could be a little overestimated.

      <h2>Is the journey more important than the destination?</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>If you are traveling in circles, then the destination means nothing to you, for you will end right where you started. 
          For the character of Louise in "Story of your life" (Chiang, 1998, p. 305) knowing the future is only a part, but you 
          still have to act upon it, make the journey. She reflects on this when she thinks about trying to explain it to someone 
          else: “if the heptapods already knew everything that they would ever say or hear, what was the point of their using 
          language at all?”. She states that their conversations are not informative, but performative, they talk so what they 
          know can come to be.</p>
        <p>Parallel to this, in the movie “Arrival” (2016), where are made to understand that Louise knew her daughter would die, 
          and that she had a choice not to conceive her, but that she chose to live the journey of experiencing the love of her 
          daughter, knowing that it would end in pain.</p>
        <p>Life itself is a journey, and the destination, the end of our lives, is what matters less. In fact, we spend most of 
          our lives trying not to think of it; and instead focusing, and enjoying, the journey itself.

      <h2>Is free will real, or is it only the feel that we have it?</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In “Story of your life”, one of the main subjects is free will. The heptapods and the humans that learn their 
          language can see the future, as well as the past, because of the nonlinear nature of it; and this makes Louise reflect 
          on the nature of free will. She states that free will does exist for those that see time as linear, but that both 
          freedom and restriction are things that do not apply to those that see time as simultaneous, as they do; and that both 
          are valid interpretations (Chiang, 1998, p. 305).</p>
        <p>Although Louise states that these two forms of interpreting time and will can coexist, that one does not negate the 
          other; that is not true for the debate of free will vs determinism. Determinism states that every action has a cause, 
          even what could be seem a random choice in our brain, is the result of previous actions that led to our brain state that 
          made that decision. In this scenario, it is our ignorance of the actions that caused our seemingly random choice, that 
          create the sensation of free will. If it is so, does it really matter then that we have no free will? As long as we feel 
          like we have, or that there are no mayor outside forces constricting our choices, then let us enjoy our blissful 
          ignorance.

      <h2>Do we hinder our communications with others, just because they are different?</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>in the movie “Arrival” (2016), there is a scene where the humans are trying to establish communication with the 
          aliens, and this is the first time that the character of Louise meets them. We see in this scene that she removes her 
          suit so the aliens could actually see her, despite the fear of those that surrounded her; we see that she is intended 
          in really connecting with the aliens in order to understand them and communicate with them.</p>
        <p>Both in the movie and the novella “Story of your life” (Chiang, 1998), we see that Louise really wants to 
          understand the heptapods so she can communicate with them, going to the point of viewing the world from their 
          perspective now, in a simultaneous way. This goes to show that, if we want to understand the message, we have to first 
          understand the interlocutor, to connect with their emotions and motivations, to feel empathy.</p>
        <p>We do not need to be trying to talk to aliens to understand that, whenever we talk to someone different from us, we 
          have to try to be empathic with that person, if we really want to understand the whole message.
